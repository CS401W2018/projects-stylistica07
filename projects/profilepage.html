    <h1>Hi! My name is Charlie Noble</h1>

    <p>I am 31 years old and I am from the Philippines. I am married with my wife Reina. We have 2 daughters. The first one is Queen Erindale and the second one is Queen Cassadee. As you noticed, the "queen" at the beginning of their names came from my wife's name because "queen" in Spanish is Reina. Erindale's name holds a special part in my heart as it is the name of the street of where I lived during my first area in my mission in Perth, Australia. Cassadee's name is from my favorite female vocalist in a band called "Hey Monday".</p>

    <p>I am passionate about technology and computers that is why I chose Information technology as my major. I also love to play competitive computer games like DOTA 2 and Valorant.</p>
