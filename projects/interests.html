        <p>Cooking has become one of my favorite ways to unwind after a busy day. I often cook for myself, but sometimes I also enjoy preparing meals for my family and friends. It’s a rewarding process that allows me to take time for myself, try new recipes, and enjoy a home-cooked meal.</p>
        
        <p>One of my favorite aspects of cooking is that it’s a skill that continually evolves. I can constantly learn new recipes from different cultures, explore unique ingredients, and challenge myself with complex dishes. Each meal I prepare brings a sense of accomplishment and joy, especially when I can serve it to others.</p>

An absolute link, on the other hand, directs you to an external website. Here's an <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com">absolute link to Food Network</a>, one of my favorite cooking resources.</p>
