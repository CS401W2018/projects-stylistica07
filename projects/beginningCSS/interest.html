        <p>Cooking has become one of my favorite ways to unwind after a long busy day. I often cook for myself, but sometimes I also enjoy preparing meals for my family and friends. It’s a rewarding process that allows me to take time for myself, try new recipes, and enjoy a home-cooked meal.</p>
        
        <p class="description">One of my favorite aspects of cooking is that it’s a skill that continually evolves. I can constantly learn new recipes from different cultures, explore unique ingredients, and challenge myself with complex dishes.</p>

        <h2>About my Design Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What color did you choose to emphasize text? <span class="emphasized-text">I chose red (#d9534f) to emphasize important text</span>.</li>
            <li>What color did you choose to de-emphasize text? <span class="deemphasize">I chose light grey (#999999) to de-emphasize less important text.</span></li>
            <li>How did you choose your colors? I used an online color tool to find colors that contrast well but are easy to read.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A relative link connects to another file on the same server or within the same website. For example, here is a <a href="page.html">relative link to my Profile Page</a>. An absolute link, on the other hand, directs you to an external website. Here's an <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com">absolute link to Food Network</a>, one of my favorite cooking resources.</p>
