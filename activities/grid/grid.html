        <ol>
            <li>How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class?<br>
            It is recommended to spend around 1 - 2 hours on engagement assignments after class. This will allow you to properly reinforce the concepts discussed during the class.</li>
            
            <li>What should you focus on during class and after class?<br>
            During class, focus on actively listening, understanding new concepts, and taking notes. After class, focus on revisiting notes, completing assignments, and practicing the topics covered.</li>
            
            <li>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?<br>
            CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to work with both rows and columns simultaneously. CSS Flexbox, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional layout system that is ideal for handling layout in either a row or a column.</li>
