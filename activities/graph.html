        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h3>
        <p>JPEG is good for photos with lots of colors and details, like landscapes, portraits, or anything with gradients. It compresses well while keeping quality.</p>

        <h3>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h3>
        <p>GIF works best for simple images with fewer colors, like logos, icons, and animations. It supports transparency and simple motion.</p>

        <h3>What is unique about the PNG format?</h3>
        <p>PNG supports transparency and keeps images clear without losing quality, especially for images with text or sharp lines.</p>

        <h3>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h3>
        <p>You can resize your photo using photo editing software before uploading it, so itâ€™s at the exact size needed for the website.</p>

        <h3>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h3>
        <p>Resizing with photo editing software makes the image smaller and loads faster. CSS only changes the display size, not the actual file size, so the image can still be slow to load.</p>
