    <h1>Engagement - CSS Selectors</h1>
    <h2>Ways to select an item</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>By element/tag name</li>
        <li>By ID</li>
        <li>By class</li>
        <li>By attribute</li>
        <li>By pseudo-class</li>
        <li>By By pseudo-element</li>
        <li>By descendant or child</li>
        <li>By grouping selectors</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Difference between an ID and a Class</h2>
    <p>-The main difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is unique to a single element on a page, 
        ensuring specific, individual styling, while a class can be applied to multiple elements, 
        allowing shared styling across different parts of the page. IDs are used for one-off elements, whereas classes 
        are more flexible and reusable.</p>
    


    <h2>The difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag</h2>
    <p>The difference between a SPAN and a DIV tag is that a SPAN is an inline element used to style or 
        group small portions of content without breaking the flow of text, while a DIV is a 
        block-level element used to create larger sections or containers that typically structure or 
        group content, causing a line break before and after the element.</p>

    <h2>The difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER</h2>
    <p>The difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, and FOOTER is that a DIV is a generic container without 
        any inherent meaning or purpose, used for grouping content or layout. In contrast, HEADER, MAIN, 
        and FOOTER are semantic elements that define specific, meaningful sections of a webpage: 
        HEADER for the top section (typically navigation or branding), MAIN for the primary content, 
        and FOOTER for the bottom section, usually containing information like copyright or contact details.</p>


    <h2>Different ways to select a colo</h2>
    <p>Different ways to select a color include using hexadecimal codes, GB values,RGBA values for transparency,
        HSL values, HSLA values for transparency, and predefined color names.
