    <h1>Engagement - Beginning CSS </h1>
    <p>1. Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline CSS is used directly within an HTML tag using the 'style' attribute. It affects only that specific element.</li>
        <li>Embedded CSS (or internal CSS) is placed within the "style" tags in the "head"
            section of an HTML document, affecting elements on that page based on the specified selectors.</li>
        <li>External CSS involves linking a separate .css file to the HTML document using the "link" tag.</li>
        This file can style multiple web pages if they all link to it.
    </ul>
    
    <p>2. Explain why you should only use external CSS.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using external CSS promotes cleaner HTML and makes your website easier to maintain. 
                It allows you to change styles across multiple pages by editing a single file, 
                ensures consistent styling, and can improve page load times when cached by the browser.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>3. What is a selector used for?
        <ul>
            <li>A selector is used to target HTML elements and apply specific styles to them. 
                It identifies which elements the CSS rules will affect, based on elements' attributes like id, class, or type.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
