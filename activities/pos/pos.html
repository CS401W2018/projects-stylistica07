      <h3>Answers to Engagement Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Block tags take up the full width and start on a new line. Inline tags only take up as much space as their content and stay in line with other elements.</li>
        <li>Normal flow is how HTML elements naturally arrange themselves on a page. Block elements stack vertically, while inline elements line up next to each other.</li>
        <li>Float moves an element to the left or right and allows text or other elements to wrap around it. Clearing the float ensures the parent container adjusts to the floated element's height..</li>
        <li>Absolute positioning places an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the page itself. Fixed positioning keeps the element in place even when the page scrolls, while relative positioning shifts the element from its original spot but keeps it in the normal flow.</li>
        <li>Make buttons large enough to tap easily on touchscreens. Using responsive design and flexible layouts, like flexbox or grid, helps create navigation that works well on mobile devices.</li>
        <li>Class videos are usually posted on the universityâ€™s learning platform, like Canvas or Blackboard. If not, ask your teacher for links to where you can review them.</li>
