                <h3>Pahiyas Festival</h3>

                <p>Held in Lucban, Quezon, the Pahiyas Festival celebrates the harvest with colorful rice decorations and delicious local dishes like Pancit Habhab. This noodle dish, also known as Pancit Lucban, originated in Quezon province and is distinct from other pancit varieties. <a href="https://panlasangpinoy.com/pancit-habhab-recipe/" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
                <p>Pancit Habhab uses dried flour noodles called miki Lucban, which are different from pancit canton noodles or fresh miki noodles. This dish is traditionally served on a banana leaf and eaten without utensils. To enjoy it, diners grab the banana leaf with noodles and eat directly from it, similar to how one might eat a sandwich (but donâ€™t eat the banana leaf!).</p>

                <p>For added flavor, Pancit Habhab is best enjoyed with a splash of cane vinegar, enhancing its tangy and savory profile. This unique dish reflects the simplicity and resourcefulness of Filipino cuisine.</p>

                <h3>Lechon Festival</h3>
                <p>The town of Balayan in Batangas is home to the Parada ng Lechon, or Roasted Pig Parade, which takes place every June 24th to honor St. John the Baptist and the submersion of Jesus Christ. Residents and neighboring regions prepare lechon for the parade, creatively dressing them according to various themes, such as a motorcyclist, a student, or even a basketball player.</p>
                <p>Before the parade begins, a mass is held at the Immaculate Conception Church, and the lechon are blessed. The fun begins with a water-splashing tradition and opportunities for spectators to enjoy a taste of lechon during the parade. Participants and visitors can expect nonstop eating, drinking, and other exciting activities after the parade. <a href="https://www.hellotravel.com/events/parada-ng-lechon" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
